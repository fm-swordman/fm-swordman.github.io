I am a master student currently studying at the [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes fault diagnosis of power cables and cable fault location.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Assoc. Prof. Da-Ning Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/daningzhang) of High Voltage Discharge and Plasma Group from [School of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an Jiaotong University. Prior to this, I was advised by [Assoc. Prof. Shuai Mao](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/maoshuai) from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), Northwestern Polytechnical University.

You can find my CV here: [Chentong Ye's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
